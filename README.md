#Solving the travelling salesman problem with quantum annealing.

The script shows the use of a D-Wave system for solving the classical salesman optimisation problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).

Due to the nature of quantum annealing, the problems must be rewritten in the form of an Ising Hamiltonian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ising_model). Specifically for the travelling salesman problem, the mathematical formulation was taken from https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2014.00005/full, where the formulations of many other classical problems are shown.
